# Caregiver Shift Tracker API

Backend service for the Blue Horn Tech caregiver scheduling assignment. The API is written in Go (1.22), follows a clean architecture layering, and persists data in PostgreSQL. It exposes REST endpoints for schedules, tasks, and a lightweight OAuth2/OIDC-style token flow so the frontend can authenticate via client credentials.

## Tech Stack

- Go 1.22
- Gin as the HTTP router
- sqlx with pgx driver for PostgreSQL
- Zap structured logging
- JWT (HS256) tokens for the faux OIDC flow
- Plain SQL migrations (stored in `/migrations`)

### Why this stack?

- **Go**: chosen for its lightweight concurrency model (goroutines typically start with a ~2 KB stack) which keeps the service responsive as IO-bound workloads grow.
- **PostgreSQL**: reliable relational store with strong JSON support and mature tooling; fits the structured scheduling data well.
- **Gin + sqlx**: thin abstractions that stay close to the metal while still providing productivity with routing, middleware, and query helpers.
- **Zap logging & JWT**: structured logs aid debugging, while signed tokens unlock a simple “OIDC-like” client-credentials flow shared with the frontend.

```

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- Docker (recommended for local PostgreSQL)
- Alternatively: PostgreSQL 14+ installed locally

## Configuration

Copy the sample environment file and adjust as needed:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Key variables:

- `APP_HOST`, `APP_PORT` – server bind address.
- `DB_*` – Postgres connection settings.
- `AUTH_*` – secrets + token metadata for the pseudo-OIDC flow. Update the secrets for production use.

## Quick start (recommended)

Use Docker Compose (provided in the repository root) to start PostgreSQL and run the API. From the repository root run:

```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL
docker compose up -d postgres

# 2. Copy env configuration (edit if needed)
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env

# 3. Apply the SQL migrations (seeds demo data)
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U postgres -d care_tracker < backend/migrations/0001_init.sql
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U postgres -d care_tracker < backend/migrations/0002_logs_caregivers.sql

#    The seed inserts a caregiver with ID `c2d1bb61-8d67-4db5-9e59-4c2c16f7d4f2`
#    and registers the OAuth client `caregiver-app / caregiver-secret`. Make sure
#    your `.env` values (e.g. `AUTH_DEFAULT_CAREGIVER_ID`) continue to match.

# 4. Start the API
cd backend
go run ./cmd
```

When the server prints `🚀 care-shift-tracker` it is ready on `http://localhost:8080`. Press `ctrl+c` to stop it, then tear down the database with `docker compose down` (or keep it running for the frontend).

## Database Setup

If you prefer a locally installed Postgres, create the database and run the migrations manually:

1. Create the database:
   ```bash
   createdb care_tracker
   ```
2. Run the migration SQL (includes seed data and attendance logs table):
   ```bash
   psql "$DB_USER" -h "$DB_HOST" -d "$DB_NAME" -f migrations/0001_init.sql
   psql "$DB_USER" -h "$DB_HOST" -d "$DB_NAME" -f migrations/0002_logs_caregivers.sql
   ```
   (Ensure the environment variables in your shell line up with `.env`.)

The migration seeds a default caregiver, schedules, tasks, and an OAuth client (`caregiver-app`) with the plaintext secret `caregiver-secret` (hashed in the DB).

## Running the API

```bash
cd backend
go run ./cmd
```

or build and run:

```bash
cd backend
go build -o bin/api ./cmd
./bin/api
```

The server listens on `APP_HOST:APP_PORT` (defaults to `0.0.0.0:8080`). A healthcheck is available at `GET /healthz`.

## Auth Flow (OIDC “Wannabe”)

The `/api/auth/token` endpoint implements a simplified client-credentials exchange:

- Request body: form-encoded or JSON with `grant_type=client_credentials`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, and optional `scope`.
- Response: access token (HS256 JWT), ID token (HS256), token type, expires in seconds, granted scope, and caregiver profile payload.
- The default seeded client is `caregiver-app` / `caregiver-secret`.

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "grant_type": "client_credentials",
        "client_id": "caregiver-app",
        "client_secret": "caregiver-secret"
      }'
```

Use the returned access token as a Bearer token on protected routes.

## API Documentation

- Swagger UI: `GET /docs`
- Raw OpenAPI spec: `GET /docs/openapi.yaml`

Both assets are embedded in the binary so no extra tooling is required.

## API Surface

| Method | Path                               | Description |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/token`                  | Obtain access + ID token |
| `GET`  | `/api/schedules`                   | List schedules (filter by `status`, `date` query params) |
| `GET`  | `/api/schedules/today`             | Today’s schedules + metrics |
| `GET`  | `/api/schedules/metrics`           | Aggregate counts for a given date (`?date=YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `GET`  | `/api/schedules/:id`               | Schedule detail with tasks and client info |
| `POST` | `/api/schedules/:id/start`         | Clock-in; requires `latitude` & `longitude` |
| `POST` | `/api/schedules/:id/end`           | Clock-out; requires `latitude` & `longitude` |
| `POST` | `/api/schedules/:id/tasks`         | Add a new care task to the schedule |
| `PATCH`| `/api/tasks/:taskId`               | Update task status (complete or not-complete with reason) |

All `/api/*` endpoints except `/api/auth/token` require the Bearer access token header.

## Logging

- Structured JSON logs are emitted to stdout via Zap.
- Every request also lands in the `request_logs` Postgres table (method, path, status, latency, IP, user-agent) for later auditing/analytics.

## Testing the Flow Quickly

```bash
# 1) Token
token=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"client_id":"caregiver-app","client_secret":"caregiver-secret"}' | jq -r '.access_token')

# 2) List schedules
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" http://localhost:8080/api/schedules
```

## Notes & Next Steps

- The logging middleware currently records request metadata; hook in trace IDs or structured request bodies as needed.
- Schedule status transitions are guarded in the use case layer; extend with additional validation or auditing tables for production environments.
- Swap secrets and token signing to asymmetric keys before deploying to a shared environment.
- Integrate a migration runner (e.g., `golang-migrate` or `goose`) if automated migration flow is preferred.
- Geolocation fallback: if the browser denies access, the frontend should prompt for manual latitude/longitude entry and send those values to the backend. Document any alternative flows in the frontend README when implemented.
- Run unit tests with `go test ./...` to validate use cases and auth flows.

## Assumptions

- The domain model was inferred from the assignment brief; some tables/fields may evolve once full business rules are clarified.
- The seeded caregiver ID (`c2d1bb61-8d67-4db5-9e59-4c2c16f7d4f2`) is wired into `.env.example` to keep the mock OIDC flow working out of the box.
- Attendance logging requirements were interpreted broadly, so the schema may require tweaks once end-to-end flows are finalized.
